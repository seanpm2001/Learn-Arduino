// About:
// I decided to make Arduino the main project language file for this project (Seanpm2001/Learn-Arduino) as Arduino is the language this project is dedicated to, because this project is about learning the Arduino programming language. It only makes sense to Arduino the official language for this project. It is getting its own project language file, starting here.
